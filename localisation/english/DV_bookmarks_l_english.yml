  OTHER_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "On February 15, 1933, a deranged, unemployed brick layer named Giuseppe Zangara shouts 'Too many people are starving!' and fires a gun at America’s president-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt. In this timeline, his assassination attempt is succesful. The consequences of which, are enormous. The USA remains committed to Isolationism, neglecting rearmament and leand lease. Additionally they have a harder time recovering from the great depression without Roosevelt's economic policies. A weaker USA allows Germany to end World War II with the allies on favorable terms."
 
  GER_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The Greater Germanic Reich emerged from World War II a triumphant yet exhausted power. The Nazis unilaterally declared the war in the east to be over, and held a massive military parade in Berlin, now called Germania. Hitler is revered as a hero for having taken out Germany from ruin and achieving Endsieg. The allies, nominally at peace with Germany, are pressing Hitler to honor his agreement and give full independence to Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. In the east, the Soviets, still lead by Joseph Stalin are plotting their revenge, arming division after division with american equipment. Will the Reich last for a thousand years?"
 
  SOV_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union, once a Great Power, now stands alone in the wastelands of Siberia. After the line of A-A was bypassed, the Soviets accepted the peace deal, and signed an official pact with the Nazis. Now, Stalin, who has been called out for being a horrible Leader, is planning to retake his Eastern lands, as the allies and the Soviets are planning things, we see tons of new Industrialization issues within Siberia, as the frozen wastelands arent kept up enough. Sooner or later, the Soviet Union itself will crumble."
  VIF_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The French emerged, well, as one of the most understandibly surrenderung and low morale nations. It fought during the early 40s with the brits against the then ravaging lion of Germany. After the terrors of Dunkerque and Paris, the French surrendered with the Brits in 1944. The Germans promised the French independance, but that was falsely claimed, as an "Independant French State" lead by Petain is currently being led, the situation remains in limbo for the past 6 years, however, it is as a fact that many african colonies are still under the Free French support and influence, as they continue to make radical measures, the French situation is unknown to the Public."
  ENG_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The Brits, fighting alongside the French, Churchill was exiled in disgrace after the failed invasion at Normandy. Halifax promptly sued for peace. With this, the war "officially" ended on the Western fronts, yet USA and the British with the Free French forces are trying desperate measures to gain control of the French State, many now know of what happened to the Allies, all thats left is a crumbled France, desperate Britain and a Neutral, Isolated USA. "
  USA_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "There is will for the Americans to fight in the European Theatre, but there are measure to counter the German influence, as the Pearl Harbour attacks were executed by the Japanese in 1941, America, dragging its feet in the European  Theatre, focused its war efforts against Japan. In this scenario, the Germans never officially declared war on the Americans. Since the Americans suffered a total Stock Market Crash in 1929, it remains to be seen if America will recover from its past mistakes. Without a stable economy, if the Germans ever step foot in America, the war would be as good as won. "
  ITA_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "Italy, whilst being an ally of Germany, never officially declared its mending ties with the German War Machine, instead, it fought alongside them to clear out the European and African continent for "Living Space". Now that Mussolini remains victorious with a Greater Italy, however, the Germans have caught up to the plans that some day, the Italians will probably go their own racially superior path, as Hitler announces that an Italian Puppet is assured, with no new news being laid by the Nazis, it is only a matter of time."
