  OTHER_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "On February 15, 1933, a deranged, unemployed brick layer named Giuseppe Zangara shouts 'Too many people are starving!' and fires a gun at America’s president-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt. In this timeline, his assassination attempt is succesful. The consequences of which, are enormous. The USA remains committed to Isolationism, neglecting rearmament and leand lease. Additionally they have a harder time recovering from the great depression without Roosevelt's economic policies. A weaker USA allows Germany to end World War II with the allies on favorable terms."
 
  GER_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The Greater Germanic Reich emerged from World War II a triumphant yet exhausted power. The Nazis unilaterally declared the war in the east to be over, and held a massive military parade in Berlin, now called Germania. Hitler is revered as a hero for having taken out Germany from ruin and achieving Endsieg. The allies, nominally at peace with Germany, are pressing Hitler to honor his agreement and give full independence to Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. In the east, the Soviets, still lead by Joseph Stalin are plotting their revenge, arming division after division with american equipment. Will the Reich last for a thousand years?"
 
  SOV_END_OF_WW2_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union, once a Great Power, now stands alone in the wastelands of Siberia. After the line of A-A was bypassed, the Soviets accepted the peace deal, and signed an official pact with the Nazis. Now, Stalin, who has been called out for being a horrible Leader, is planning to retake his Eastern lands, as the allies and the Soviets are planning things, we see tons of new Industrialization issues within Siberia, as the frozen wastelands arent kept up enough. Sooner or later, the Soviet Union itself will crumble."
